This code is a password generator that processes a user-selected image to generate a random password. It uses the Pillow library for image processing and the tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface. The user selects an image, specifies the desired password length, and the program converts the image to grayscale, extracts pixel values, and maps these values to random printable characters to create a password. The password is then displayed in a text widget for easy copying. The interface is enhanced with styling and includes a logo in the title bar for better user experience.
PS: I downloaded the logo from some random website
